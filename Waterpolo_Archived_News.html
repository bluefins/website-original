<p>Basingstoke arrived in Sevenoaks with a very young squad, but one eager to get a good result against a full Sevenoaks team. With the chance of a first place finish in the south east league a very real possibility it was important to get a good result.</p>

<p><br />
The game started off cagey, with Basingstoke keen not to concede too many goals in the first quarter so as not to give themselves too much work to do for the rest of the match, especially with only one sub available.</p>

<p>Despite this, Sevenoaks opened the scoring with a shot at the near post, a goal which galvanised the Basingstoke youngsters into a quick response, burying the next chance they got to level the scoring. Now that both teams were on the score sheet, the game opened up, with both teams attacks looking dangerous, and the game flowing from end to end much quicker. Despite the advantage of numbers on the Sevenoaks side, Basingstoke were giving as good as they got, and keeping themselves in the game with key goals from Jack Taylor and James Stone boosting their tally.</p>

<p>The long hours Basingstoke put in at training began to show dividends, with some excellent ball defence and clever attacking passes leading to numerous man up situations, and good steals of the ball in defence. A notable highlight was a good link up between Jake Cleverley and Alex Pullen, the latter making a clever break into the pit before driving to back post, with Jake picking him out with a pinpoint pass for Alex to catch and score in one movement.</p>

<p>As the game went on and legs began to tire, Basingstoke began to falter. Leading by 3 goals early on in the final quarter, Sevenoaks pegged them back bit by bit before finally drawing even. In response to this rough patch, Basingstoke called a time out to try and break the momentum of the other team, and get their noses back in front. Straight from the restart, Basingstoke put a clever plan into action, distracting the defence enough to leave Jack Taylor with enough space to receive the ball, and bury it in the top corner.</p>

<p>For the final minute the game was extremely tense, Sevenoaks going all out to equalise, with Basingstoke putting their bodies on the line to ensure that whatever happened, the ball stayed out of the net. After what seemed like an eternity, the final whistle went and Basingstoke could finally relax.</p>

<p>Overall, despite numbers being against the team, and with more than a few pessimistic faces among them, Basingstoke emerged deservedly victorious. It can safely be said that everyone put in a performance to be proud of, and all could leave knowing that they didn&rsquo;t win through luck, or chance, but because they outplayed the opposition and got the result they deserved. Well done to all who played.</p>

<p>Team: Mike Sheath, James Stone, Jack Taylor, Sam Taylor, Jake Cleverley, Alex Pullen, Cameron Burns, Daniel James</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

<div>&nbsp;As it happened, Basingstoke started the game well disciplined and in control, nullifying the Southampton attack and getting off the mark with two quick goals courtesy of Steve Fairhead and Matt Hewitt. The tension in the game began to show with numerous sending outs, Southampton clinical in the attack to score their man up attacks and claw the score back to 10-3 at the end of the first quarter.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The second quarter began similar to how the first ended, with numerous sending outs meaning the Stingrays began to assert their authority. Four goals without reply gave Southampton hope that they would be back on level terms at half time, but Basingstoke had other ideas. Dave Egan was a constant thorn in the side of the opposition defence, and two goals from him at the end of the quarter meant Basingstoke went into the half time break leading 12 goals to 7, still holding a comfortable lead and knowing they were two quarters away from victory.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>As the third quarter started, there was a shift in the atmosphere as both teams knew the hardest half lay ahead. The fans were in good voice, and cheered the players on superbly, giving both teams a boost in the pool. Despite this, the third quarter proved to be the most tightly contested, Basingstoke putting their focus on maintaining their lead and Southampton aiming to concede as few as possible so as not to leave them out of sight for the final quarter. Another goal from Dave Egan and a fantastic finish from James Stone as good as cancelled out the three goals scored by Southampton in the third to leave Basingstoke with 8 minutes to defend a 4 goal lead.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Basingstoke could sense victory, but knew they had to maintain their focus or risk slipping behind at the most crucial point of the match. As it happened, the Bluefins held firm and controlled the game superbly. 5 minutes into the final quarter and young guns James Stone, Josh Lay and Jack Taylor had grabbed a goal each, and sterling defensive work at the other end meant Southampton had no reply. The Stingrays were not to be denied for long, and a couple of quick fire goals meant there was no relaxed finish, Basingstoke would be pushed right to the end for their victory. In their desperation to score, Southampton flooded forward and a good counter saw Josh Lay add another to his tally. The clock ran down, and there were cheers from the crowd when goalkeeper Mike Sheath saved the final attempt on the buzzer, and confirmed Basingstoke as champions, with the final score 19-13.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>A memorable final, and a fantastic result for Basingstoke.</div>
