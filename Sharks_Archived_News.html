<p>Pupils from Dove House, Maple Ridge, Chalkridge Schools and QMC took part in the&nbsp;Basingstoke&nbsp;Special Schools Gala in October.</p>

<p>For the large majority of swimmers this was their first competitive race.</p>

<p>We were all impressed with the enthusiasm and effort shown by all the swimmers, which could clearly be seen in the high standard of swimming.</p>

<p>Well done to everyone who took part.</p>

<p>Comments from Maple Ridge Primary (Pam Brown):</p>

<p>&#39;The swimming gala was very well organised. The children came away with a real sense of achievement, and were very proud to show their medals to the rest of the school during assembly.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;It was really good fun&#39; (Josh)</p>

<p>&#39;I loved it because we were all champions&#39; (Ryan-James)</p>

<p>Comments from Chalk Ridge Primary:</p>

<p>&#39;We were all very proud that James as able to take part in the swimming competition. It was a huge achievement and we were not surprised that he did so well.&#39;<br />
Head teacher - Donna Shave</p>

<p>Comments from QMC pupils:</p>

<p>Jessica Draper - &quot;I like entering competitions, and making my coaches proud when I win medals. I love cheering on my friends in their races&quot;</p>

<p>Jordan Mancey - &quot;It was a great gala, it was good to see so many swimmers enjoying themselves.&quot;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

<p>It was fantastic to see so many of our swimmers participating in this event. For a number of our swimmers this was their&nbsp;first experience of a gala.</p>

<p>Everyone swam exceptionally well,&nbsp;with everyone obtaining at least one Personal Best.</p>

<p>Medals were presented to all those who took part by Ken Moore (Club Chairman)</p>

<p>Well done to everyone who took part and thank you to all those who helped make this such a successful event.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

Annie Edwards, Francis Chapman, Jordan Mancey and Tom Want achieved 2PB&rsquo;s. Ciar&aacute;n Kelly, Harrison Trusler and Lauren Trusler &nbsp;all achieved an amazing 3&nbsp; PB&rsquo;s.</span></p>

<p>9 of our swimmers took part in the British&nbsp;Learning Disability Swimming Championships&nbsp;which took place at Ponds Forge in Sheffield&nbsp;on the 4th May.</p>

<p>We were all impressed with the enthusiasm&nbsp;and hard work our swimmers have shown&nbsp;over the last few months.</p>

<p>Their effort has clearly paid off in the amount&nbsp;of Personal Bests (PBs) times that were&nbsp;achieved. Charlotte Egan and Tom Want achieved 1 PB, Ciar&aacute;n Kelly, George Allen and&nbsp;Jordan Mancey all achieved 2 PBs. Annie Edwards, Charlotte Trusler and Harrison&nbsp;Trusler achieved 3 PBs. Jessica Draper is now in the top group and competes against&nbsp;elite swimmers, which is not only an amazing achievement but also can be quite&nbsp;daunting.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp
