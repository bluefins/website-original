<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Basingstoke Bluefins&rsquo; Michelle Matson explains why team spirit is so important for Masters.</span></p>

<p>Pink hats, t-shirts, nail polish and all the rest of it are so much more to our team than vanity; they represent fun, friendship and a very strong sense of team spirit.</p>

<p>Although our team name suggests we should perhaps be wearing blue, pink happened by accident to begin with.</p>

<p>Open water swimming became popular in our Masters squad and for safety and visibility in the lakes we had our logo printed on fluorescent pink hats. They proved so popular swimmers were wearing them in the pool too.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Being a part of such a strong team is what swimming is all about to me. Masters meets are taken seriously, despite the pinkness, and so many of us not only attend all of our Masters training sessions but also do our own training in public sessions as well as gym sessions.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Of course enjoying each other&rsquo;s company is such a huge part of our team and more importantly being behind every swimmer and every swim they do is too. We particularly enjoy meets like British and National Championship, where we can all get together over dinner because let&rsquo;s face it, food is the quickest way to please a swimmer &ndash; other than a PB!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Team spirit starts far away from the pool. It&rsquo;s sharing car journeys to the pool, eating a meal together, staying at the same hotel and most definitely wearing pink! Then there&rsquo;s being at every session to watch every swimmer, swim every race and that&rsquo;s before relays are even mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Some relays are competitive and others are for fun and about giving everyone a chance to feel a part of the pinkness and therefore a part of the team. For me, relays are the most important part of a meet.</span></p>

<p>They are a chance to actually represent my team and stand as a unit behind the blocks. Relays are my main focus in training because when I&rsquo;m finding a set particularly tough, I just think about letting my team mates down and it makes it easier to get through.</p>

<p>So putting on the pink nail polish at home is just the start of all the excitement and on Monday mornings, when normality resumes, the flashes of pink left on my nails reminds me of the great meet and fab time I had with all my chlorine buddies. Never underestimate the value of being a part of a great team!</p>

<p>A great success with all swimmers coming home with Gold medals. There is no doubt this is a great meet in the best pool in the country.&nbsp;Steve Greenfield, Ian Cameron, Olly Espinasse, Spencer Turner and Fleur Parker travelled to the wonderful Ponds Forge pool in Sheffield just before Xmas to attend this meet.</p>

<p>Bluefins were on fine form and a great day. A couple of highlights were the men having a head to head showdown over 100IM. Olly took it with Spencer and Ian literally touching together, followed by Steve. The men also did 2 relays and absolutely stormed it! Winning both by over 2 seconds..</p>

<p>Last weekend saw&nbsp;Bluefins travel to Barnet for the &lsquo;distance&rsquo; meet. An interesting place to find, but a great meet. Steve Greenfield, Steve Canning, Spencer Turner, Michelle Matson, Sarah Adams, Jo Taylor and Fleur Parker were all in attendance.</p>

<p>Steve Canning started the weekend on the Saturday by a great swim in the 800 Freestyle &ndash; taking Gold! Steve then went on to swim the 400 &ndash; as Breaststroke and indeed the 200 Free where he picked up bronze. Steve was a great form all weekend and think he really enjoyed himself. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Kicking off on Sunday was the 400 Freestyle. First up this time was the ladies, with Michelle, Jo and Fleur swimming in the same heat, followed by the Distance Queen aka Ladies Captain Sarah in the final heat. Sarah, Fleur and Jo all won Gold with Michelle picking up Silver. &nbsp;Sarah finally broke the 5 minute barrier with a cracking 4:56 and a club record.</p>

<p>Steve Greenfield was up next winning the 400 freestyle in what can only be described as a comfortable swim! Spencer was seeded 2nd&nbsp;overall (Top in his age group) to the one and only Paul Palmer &ndash; ex Olympian. Spencer went out with Paul and swam a brilliant PB and club record, taking Gold. Paul was great to watch and indeed his first race in 12 years &ndash; and Spencer chased him&nbsp;J.</p>

<p>Steve Greenfield swam a great 200 Backstroke, taking Gold and a seasons best time &ndash; again looking very comfortable (how does he do it!) Fleur, Jo and Spencer were up next in the 100 Breaststroke &ndash; with Fleur taking Gold, Spencer Silver and Jo Bronze.</p>

<p>Our Bluefins Ex British Record holders team of Michelle, Jo, Sarah and Fleur fancied their chances on the Ladies 4x100 Freestyle relay against the team they lost their record to at Swansea. All swam brilliantly and were up for the challenge. Michelle kicked the relay off on the first leg &ndash; with a storming 1.04, giving the team a superb lead after an truly gutsy swim. Jo, Sarah and Fleur then followed and the lead continued to grow with the ladies taking the Gold in a time of 4:32.62, 9 seconds ahead of their rivals.</p>

<p>200 Freestyle saw a number of the team in &ndash; Jo, Michelle, Fleur, Spencer &amp; Steve. Spencer and Fleur picked up Gold&rsquo;s, Michelle Silver, Steve and Jo Bronze &ndash; great effort from the fins on this one.</p>

<p>Catherine Shearn swam the 100 Fly, winning Gold and beating her entry time.. great swim!</p>

<p>As always another great days racing from the fins&hellip; Next up is Rushmoor on Saturday 26th&nbsp;for a Long course meet. This will see Catherine warming up ready for her trip to the World Championships in Montreal over the summer. In addition - Steve Greenfield, Neil Mitchell, Steve Canning, Mark Straw, Michelle Matson, Sharon Lock, Emma Oliver and Fleur Parker are all competing.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

              <span class="blogTitle">National Masters Long Course Championships - 2014</span>
              


<p>Mid June saw 12 Bluefins travel to Swansea for the British Gas Masters &amp; Senior Age Group Championships. The pool was already deemed as one of the best and it didn&rsquo;t disappoint - &nbsp;what a lovely 50m pool. The championships started Friday and ran through to Sunday early evening.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Bluefins were out to impress and they didn&rsquo;t fail. With what can only be deemed as an extremely successful weekend with our best medal haul at Long Course Nationals and indeed so many personal best times were not only broken but in some instances &ndash; smashed!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Starting off the weekend was Mark Straw in his first 1500m, he took nearly a minute off his entry time and picked up a bronze &ndash; awesome start to the weekend. Mark then went on to pick up silver in the 800 Freestyle. The rest of the Bluefins crew arrived for the late session on Friday to take on their events. Captain Neil Mitchell was on fine form, practically hitting a Personal Best every time he left the blocks &ndash; he swam no fewer than 9 individuals plus relays. His best placing was Bronze in the 50 Back, although possibly the best race was his 400IM &ndash; massive PB and cracking swim.</span></p>

<p>Spencer Turner then started what can only be described as not only his best Nationals result ever, but that by any Bluefins Individual. Spencer won the 200, 400 and 800 Free and picked up Silver in the 100 Free, setting numerous PBs throughout the weekend. Chasing down the Golds was also Coach Steve Greenfield &ndash; winning the 50 back to go alongside a silver in the 50 Free and a Bronze in the 200 Back. The 50 Back was a PB for Steve, getting closer now to that British Record.</p>

<p>Our newest Bluefin &ndash; Keith Spence was on fine form and has certainly been knocking out more PBs since becoming a &lsquo;fin&rsquo;. He also looked superb in the new black/pink race skins keeping up with the Bluefins new &lsquo;Pink&rsquo; kit. Keith finished in the Top 10 in all 7 events. Andy &lsquo;Tiger&rsquo; Taylor opted for the 50s (excl Back) and swam well throughout the weekend, in addition offering lots of support to the fins.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Not to be outdone and always up for a challenge were the Bluefins ladies. Catherine Shearn had a great meet &ndash; doing her usual 50, 100, 200 Fly and an 800 free. Catherine picked up silver for the 200 and bronze in the 100. She was also part of a relay that were unfortunately DQ&rsquo;d where she swam an amazing gutsy 100 Fly.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Ladies Captain - Sarah Adams, aka Distance Queen had a busy weekend picking up Bronze in the 800 Free and a 4</span><sup style="line-height: 1.6em;">th</sup><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;in the 400 Free. Jo Taylor was on fine form &ndash; again with so many best times. She also picked up 4 Bronzes for the 200 IM, 100, 400 and 800 Free. Michelle Matson won her first National title in the 200 fly &ndash; a great event to watch when she and Catherine went head to head and neither could see each other &ndash; superb as a spectator. Fleur Parker set a PB long course for 100 Free, picking up Bronze to go with another Bronze in the 100 Back and Silver in the 200.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Jean Hanna enjoyed the weekend&rsquo;s events and did great in both the 200 Free when she picked up 4</span><sup style="line-height: 1.6em;">th</sup><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;and the 400 Free finishing in 5</span><sup style="line-height: 1.6em;">th</sup><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">. Be great to see Jean at some more Nationals in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">As always the relays not only proved to be a great success, but a lot of fun, with some very close finishes.</span></p>

<p>GOLD &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ladies 4 * 50 Medley&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah, Fleur, Michelle &amp; Jo &ndash; last minute change to the team and still a brilliant Gold!</p>

<p>GOLD &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ladies 4 * 100 Freestyle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catherine, Jean, Jo &amp; Fleur &ndash; terrific swim from Catherine with lifetime PB</p>

<p>GOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed 4 * 50 Freestyle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spencer, Steve, Michelle &amp; Fleur &ndash; the Eindhoven team didn&rsquo;t disappoint with a nail biting touch finish to take Gold! PB also to Spencer for his swim in this one</p>

<p>SILVER&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ladies 4 * 50 Freestyle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah, Michelle, Jo &amp; Fleur &nbsp;- Great long course split of 27 for Fleur in this one</p>

<p>SILVER&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ladies 4 * 200 Freestyle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle, Jo, Sarah, Fleur &ndash; the team broke their own PB/British record by 5 seconds &ndash; unfortunately they lost the Gold and record to another team&hellip;</p>

<p>SILVER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed 4 * 100 Freestyle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle, Neil, Spencer, Fleur &ndash; Great team swim, Spencer went a second quicker here than in his individual</p>

<p>BRONZE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed 4 * 100 Medley&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle, Keith, Neil and Jo &ndash; Keith&rsquo;s first National medal &ndash; awesome team swim</p>

<p>BRONZE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed 4 * 200 Freestyle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy, Jo, Mark, Michelle &ndash; super team swim including Team Tiger Taylor swimming together</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">All in all a super weekend &ndash; some outstanding swims and lots of laughs. For those of you yet to come to a big meet &ndash; why not join us in October at Sheffield?</span></p>&nbsp;&nbsp

              <span class="blogTitle">Bluefins Win Top Team!</span>
              


<p>Bluefins Masters win&nbsp;our first Top Team trophy at the 13th Royal Navy Masters Open Meet.</p>

<p>Sunday 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;March saw 25 Bluefin&rsquo;s travel to the Royal Navy Masters meet, held in the amazing Millfield School, Somerset. We set out with one goal &ndash; to bring home Top Team and we did it!!! Congratulations to the entire team that went &ndash; a fantastic achievement and our first, outside of winning the Hampshire&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Swimmers attending: Tony, James, Mark, Simon, Keith, Steve Canning, Olly, Joe, Matt, Jack, Steve, Jean, Spencer, Neil, Steve Greenfield, Emma, Zoe, Michelle, Jo, Andy, Sarah, Frank, Catherine, Bryn &amp; Fleur.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Not to be content on just winning the overall team award, Spencer, Neil and Emma also picked up Top Age Group Awards &ndash; Spencer for the 4</span><sup style="line-height: 1.6em;">th</sup><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;year running.</span></p>

<p>We had so many great swims, but a few stood out that need a special mention. Olly sticking to his 50m swims picked up 3 Gold&rsquo;s and 3 meet records. We had Matt, Jack, Keith and Joe for the first bluefins outing and we hope they had a great day and come back for more. All swam really well &ndash; Keith picked up a PB so hopefully that&rsquo;s good enough to put the Bluefin&rsquo;s hat on again. Matt and Jack both swam better than they expected with some pretty outstanding times. Jack played his part well in the very competitive 120 v 160 relay teams. Joe swam an amazing 29 without a tumble turn &ndash; question is how quick is he going to go once he&rsquo;s got that working??</p>

<p>Neil swam a staggering amount of races and hit PBs over 50 Free and 50 Breast to show the gym is definitely worth it and Spencer also set PBs in a great 400 free and 50 Back. Spencer also went on to set 4 meet records &ndash; not bad for a days work! In that same event, James listened perfectly to Tony and did an amazing 400 free and of course waved on to his adoring fans. Not to be outdone Tony and Mark both swam well in the same race and indeed over all other swims that day. The rivalry was excellent with Mark winning on all until the last race. The 100 free&hellip; Tony had waited all day to beat Mark and he did by 0.01!!!! Amazing race to watch. It seems the Bluefins like rivalry &ndash; Bryn and Spencer in the 50 breaststroke &ndash; great race and amazing to watch, with Bryn just nipping it!</p>

<p>Zoe decided to swim an entire decathlon in the day (mad lady) but the interesting suits &ndash; spider woman and a cow ensure we knew where she was at all times. Comment of the day after getting out of the 400 &ndash; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like sprints&rsquo;. Emma also was up for an amazing amount of events (even if a little hung over from the night before). She swam brilliantly all day, setting PBs race after race, the most memorable being 1.18 in the 100 Breast (twice) &ndash; 3 seconds quicker than she went at the same meet the year before. Emma also set 2 meet records.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The Bluefins relays were out in force again picking up some valuable points, more rivalry and a meet record.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Team Taylor were on fine form as always &ndash; in and out of the pool. Everyone had a great day with a spot of swimming and of course bringing home the trophy! Huge thanks to Michelle for arranging all the relays that as always proved very successful.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Well done to everyone that swam &ndash; superb team effort! Don&rsquo;t forget to check out are website to see if you have broken a club record &ndash; with so many amazing swims, I think there should be quite a few.</span></p>

<p>Such an amazing lot of swims this weekend at the SER champs at Crawley.</p>

<p>Our Bluefins male team of Dave, Steve, Olly and Andy all had a great weekend. Dave Davenport was consistent over the weekend with no sign of injury which was great to see. All his races were faster than he swam at Plymouth last year so he was delighted. He picked up Gold in 100, 400, 800 Free and Silver in the 200 Free. Coach Steve swam 50 Free and 50 Back both in very fast times picking up 2 Gold medals. Olly picked up Gold in the 50 Fly winning overall ages as well. Andy (part of team Taylor) swam well over the weekend and offered lots of support to all.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, the ladies were on top form too...</p>

<p>Most noticeable performances came in the 2 relays (and the most amount of noise!!). The Ladies 4 x200 Freestyle relay of Michelle, Jo, Sarah and Fleur won Gold and set a&nbsp;British Record&nbsp;&ndash; breaking the previous one by 14 seconds. Bluefins first British Masters Record&hellip;.. The team, still on a high went on to win the 4X50 Medley relay.Individually the ladies did well too - Catherine Shearn had some excellent swims winning Bronze in 50 &amp; 100 Fly &amp; silver in the 800 Free with times very close to lifetime PBs &ndash; a great start to the season. Lottie joined us for her first Masters meet and once she realised it was much more laid back, she picked up some lovely shiny medals - Gold 100 Free &amp; 200 Breast, Bronze 50 Breast, 50 Free, 100 Breast. Jo (other half of team Taylor) still smiling from the relays was on superb form winning her first Gold Medal since her masters come back in the 800 Free. She also added Silver in the 100 Free &amp;200 Free and Bronze for the 400 free &amp; 200 IM &ndash; medals for all swims &ndash; excellent result!</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Club Captain Sarah added 2 more Golds for the 100 Back and 50 Breast (swims she did purely for decathlon) to her relay Golds &ndash; a fine performance. Michelle still fighting back from injury added more medals to her collection with Silver in the 50 Back and Bronze for the 50 Breast and 50 Fly. She would have picked up another medal in the 200 Back, however there was a slight misjudgment of the flags &ndash; please do ask her next time you see her! (Plate awards have started for this year&nbsp;J). Fleur retained her 200 Back regional title, adding in silver for the 100 Back and Bronze in the 100 Free. Having finished in first place on the 50 Free (beating the arch rival), she was DQ for a flyer (and a noticeable one).</p>

<p>Another great weekend had by all &ndash; lots of laughter, people stuck in their costumes, flag problems, flyers, struggling on the 50 fly (where the comment was it felt like the entire team had jumped on my back) and lots of support and cheering for everyone.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

<p>September saw 6 Basingstoke Bluefin&rsquo;s Swimmers &nbsp;and one team manager/official photographer travel to Eindhoven for the European Masters Swimming Championships. Swimming were Coach Steve Greenfield, Mark Straw, Catherine Shearn, Spencer Turner, Michelle Matson &amp; Fleur Parker along with Debbie Straw in her photographic and support role.</p>

<p>The week in the pool started off with Mark and Catherine in Eindhoven. Mark competed in the 200, 400 and 800 Freestyle along with 50 fly, achieving 18th, 13th, 14th&nbsp;and 27th&nbsp;respectively. Some great swim and excellent times.</p>

<p>Catherine started the ladies pursuit with 50, 100 &amp; 200 Fly, swimming really well and clocking up some season best times &ndash; especially in the 50 Fly &ndash; showing great fight and determination. She came 37th, 19th&nbsp;&amp; 9th&nbsp;respectively. Superb to see a Top 10 spot in the 200 Fly.</p>

<p>Part way through the week saw the arrival of the Bluefins Relay team &ndash; Steve, Spencer, Michelle &amp; Fleur. The relay team swam brilliantly securing 5th&nbsp;in Europe and a personal best time by nearly 2 seconds. The team also went on to swim individual races..</p>

<p>Steve Greenfield on a limited amount of training showed he still has it just missing the medals with 4th&nbsp;in the 100 Backstroke and then 10th&nbsp;in the 50 Fly.</p>

<p>Spencer Turner swam a personal best in the 100 Free with an outstanding 57. 92 coming 12th. He also went on to finish 19th&nbsp;in the 50 Free and 16th&nbsp;in the 100 Backstroke.</p>

<p>Michelle Matson improved by 6 seconds on her 200 Breaststroke from previous competitions this season finishing with a Top 10 spot in 9th&nbsp;place. She also swam a seasons best in the 50 Fly, finishing in 17th.</p>

<p>Fleur Parker picked up a Bronze medal in the 200 Backstroke with a personal best time and came 5th, 4th&nbsp;&amp; 5th&nbsp;respectively in the 50 Free, 100 Back and 100 Free.</p>

<p>Saturday morning saw the move from the pool to the Canal in the heart of Eindhoven. This event is certainly not a splash and dash race or for the weak hearted &ndash; 3k. Great to see 3 Bluefins up for the challenge and all swam amazingly well &ndash; Michelle, Catherine and Mark. The 3 hard core swimmers placed 14th, 17th&nbsp;&amp; 15th.</p>

<p>Well done Bluefins &ndash; great to see some amazing results in Europe!</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

              <span class="blogTitle">Bluefins storm the British Gas Masters & Seniors LC Championships</span>
              


<p>What an AMAZING weekend! 11 Bluefins travelled to Plymouth last weekend for the British Gas Masters &amp; Seniors Long Course Championships. The event ran from Friday through to Sunday and saw all 11 swimmers coming home with at least one medal, and the best National medal haul seen by the Bluefins team with a total of 50 and 5 National Titles. Overall the team finished an impressive 8th in the country.<br />
<br />
Starting off the weekend on Friday afternoon was the grueling 1500m which saw Dave Davenport kick start the meet with a Silver medal. Dave then went on to secure 2 further bronze medals in the 200 and 400m Freestyle events. Dave was delighted with his times at his first National meet since coming back from injury. The 1500 also saw Spencer Turner start his weekend adventures winning bronze over the tough distance. He then went on to secure Silver in the 200 Freestyle and 3 more Bronze medals for 100 Freestyle, 100 Backstroke and 50 Breaststroke setting numerous personal bests along the way and no scars or injuries this time round.<br />
<br />
Friday evening saw the start of the girls weekend with Michelle Matson winning Silver in the 200 Breaststroke. She then went on to win a further Silver in the 200 Backstroke. Catherine Shearn started what turned out to be a superb weekend of swimming with a seasons best time in the 100 Fly, she then carried on the weekend with more great times in the 50 and 200 Fly, also bringing home a Bronze medal on the difficult 200 Fly. Fleur Parker started the weekend with a Silver in the 50 Free and Bronze in the 100 Back, going on to win another Bronze for the 50 Backstroke and Gold for the 200 Backstroke retaining her British title for the 3rd year!<br />
<br />
Mens Captain Neil Mitchell&#39;s busy weekend started on Friday evening with a Silver in the 200 Breaststroke and he added another the following day with the toughest event on the program - 400 IM. Olly Espinasse was up for a very fast 50 Dash weekend winning his first National title in a nail biting (for his team mates) race for 50 Fly and adding a Silver for the 50 Backstroke.<br />
<br />
Mark Straw had a great weekend with some seasons best times and wife Debs was a great team support taking action photography of the team all weekend. Ladies Captain Sarah Adams was patient waiting for her races to start on Saturday afternoon and she went for all her distance events bringing home Silver in the 400 Free and a bronze over the longer 800 Free.<br />
<br />
In addition to the above individual medals Bluefins entered a host of relays for the first time. These proved to be a huge success both for the swimmers in teams but also for the team mates on the side cheering each other on.<br />
<br />
GOLD&nbsp;&middot; Mixed 160+ 800 Freestyle Steve, Emma, Michelle, Mark<br />
GOLD&nbsp;&middot; Mixed 160+ 400m Freestyle Fleur, Neil, Michelle, Spencer<br />
GOLD&nbsp;&middot; Mixed 160+ 200m Freestyle Steve, Fleur, Sarah, Spencer</p>

<p>SILVER &middot; Ladies 120 + 200m Medley Fleur, Emma, Catherine, Michelle<br />
SILVER &middot; Mixed 160+ 200m Medley Sarah, Spencer, Steve, Fleur&nbsp;</p>

<p>BRONZE &middot; Mens 160+ 200m Medley Olly, Neil, Steve, Mark<br />
BRONZE&nbsp;&middot; Ladies 120+ 200m Freestyle Sarah, Michelle, Emma, Fleur<br />
<br />
Bluefins lifted the roof this weekend with the amount of support for the team and it paid off &ndash; a terrific weekend had by all &ndash; both in and out of the pool. Next stop National Short Course in Sheffield where team Bluefins hope to take an even bigger team and challenge for more medals.&nbsp;Go Bluefins!</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

<p>Saturday 1st June saw 26 Bluefins swimmers travel to Aldershot to take part in the Hampshire Masters County Championships. The team had an amazing day retaining the Top Club award for the 4th Consecutive year.<br />
<br />
Everyone swam exceptionally well with too many great swims to mention. It was a fun day at the pool and we even had a stand in for our Captain &ndash; Neil Mitchell in the form of a life size cardboard cut-out. The Trophy was presented by Jenny Ball to both Masters Captains &ndash; Sarah Adams and Neil Mitchell.<br />
<br />
Bluefin&rsquo;s swimmers swam an amazing 166 individual races and 12 relays. We won 66 Individual Gold Medals, 38 Silvers and 19 Bronze medals alongside 2 Gold and 4 Relay Silver medals.<br />
<br />
Not to be content with the medal haul, Bluefins also set 8 new Hampshire County Championship records and an outstanding 45 new Club Records.<br />
