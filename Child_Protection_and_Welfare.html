    		<h2><span style="font-size:22px;">Child Protection and Welfare</span></h2>

<p>Basingstoke Bluefins believes that the welfare of children is everyone&#39;s responsibility, particularly when it comes to protecting children from abuse. Everyone in swimming - administrator, club official, coach, parent, friend, children themselves, everyone - can help.</p>

<p><strong>Club Policies</strong></p>

<p>Basingstoke Bluefins fully endorses the ASA&#39;s Wavepower 2012-2015 initiative for Child Protection and Welfare. A full copy of the Wavepower document can be viewed, and downloaded in each of its sections, <a href="http://www.swimming.org/asa/clubs-and-members/safeguarding-children/" target="_blank" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Individual sections deal with</p>

<p>Section 1 <a href="/assets/WP_S1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3399ff;">Child safeguarding</span></a></p>

<p>Section 2 <a href="/assets/WP_S2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3399ff;">Duty of care</span></a></p>

<p>Section 3 <a href="/assets/WP_S3.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3399ff;">Responsibility for child safety within the ASA</span></a></p>

<p>Section 4 <a href="/assets/WP_S4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3399ff;">Information and guidance to coaches, teachers and poolside helpers</span></a></p>

<p>Section 5 <a href="/assets/WP_S5.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3399ff;">Information and guidance to swimmers aged 17 and under</span></a></p>

<p>Section 6 <a href="/assets/WP_S6.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3399ff;">Information and guidance to parents</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 1.6em;">Raising Concerns</strong></p>

<p>If you have any concerns about the safety of any child in the club or the behaviour of any adults please talk to the club&#39;s welfare officer, who can be contacted via the Club Office or&nbsp; by email to: welfareofficer@bbfsc.org</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can call the ASA&#39;s SwimLine on 0808 100 4001.&nbsp; The service is provided for anyone involved in swimming, including children and young people who believe that the welfare of a young child is at risk. This could be neglect or abuse, bullying or fear of someone, or anything that is worrying you and you don&#39;t know who to discuss it with.</p>

<h2>Publicity Policy</h2>

<p><strong>This policy applies to all forms of publicity including but not limited to Basingstoke Bluefins website/Facebook/Twitter and press reports. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Basingstoke Bluefins will from time to time promote the success of the Club in some or all media formats, whether this the Club&rsquo;s success in the sporting arena or individual exceptional performances.&nbsp; This policy has been written to safeguard all our members but in particular the welfare of our young swimmers and vulnerable adults.</strong></p>

<p>The Club&rsquo;s Publicity Policy has been aligned with that of the ASA Wavepower in association with the NSPCC and other governing bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp; For further details please refer to the ASA and NSPCC websites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Parents and swimmers will be asked at the beginning of each season to consent (or not) to the use of their swimmers names and images on the media stated. <u>Photos will <strong>not</strong> be accompanied by names and therefore swimmers will not be identifiable</u>. Consent given can be withdrawn at any time.</li>
	<li>In addition &ndash; from time to time there will be occasions where the Club, parents and swimmers will wish to use identifiable photos (eg. County Champions, National Qualifiers etc.) On these occasions the Club will gain the specific consent (or not) of parents and swimmers for their images and names to be published together. Please see attached consent forms.&nbsp; All formal written consents (and non-consent) will be held on record by the Club&rsquo;s Welfare Officer.</li>
	<li>All reports whether it to go to the press or on the Club&rsquo;s website must be passed to the Club&rsquo;s Publicity Officer for approval.&nbsp; The Publicity Officer will seek clarification on any safeguarding issues directly with the Welfare Officer or ASA whichever is appropriate.</li>
	<li>The Club&rsquo;s Publicity Officer will attend Safeguarding Training</li>
	<li>All photos will be a) in the water (above the surface photos) or b) fully clothed and from the waist-up only.</li>
	<li>Videoing or taking photos during a training session is strictly prohibited. The only exception to this rule is when a coach uses video footage of your child in a controlled environment for means of instructing stroke technique</li>
	<li>All posts and photos uploaded to Bluefins social media sites by swimmers and/or parents will be subject to approval, and this media policy will be applied before such posts and photos are posted.</li>
	<li>The Club&rsquo;s closed Facebook page will initially be open only to members of the Club, ie swimmers over the age of 13 and their parents and/or primary carers unless the Club have information that this will give rise to any safeguarding issues , plus individuals who hold ASA membership cards for the Club.</li>
	<li>In the interests of safeguarding no member of the coaching or teaching staff, irrespective of whether they hold membership to the Club, will be permitted to become a member of this closed Facebook group.</li>
	<li>No member of the closed Facebook group must private message any person under the age of 18.&nbsp; This will result in immediate exclusion from the group and the Club&rsquo;s Code of Conduct will be applied.</li>
	<li>The Committee may decide in the future, subject to ASA child safeguarding guidelines, to widen the membership of the Club&rsquo;s closed Facebook page to include, for example, grandparents, however this additional membership will be considered on a case by case basis in consultation with the Club&rsquo;s Welfare Officer and at the request of members only.</li>
	<li>Access to the Club&rsquo;s Closed Facebook page will be removed when a swimmer or member terminates their membership to the Club.</li>
	<li>Facebook admin personnel will include the Welfare Officer.&nbsp; All other FB admin staff to attend Safeguarding training.</li>
	<li>All publicity mediums which involve the Club or its members will be monitored by the Club Officials and Welfare Officer on an ongoing basis. Any infringement will be identified and rectified at the earliest possible opportunity and referred to the Welfare Officer/ Officers of the Club as a breach of the Club&rsquo;s Safeguarding Policy with appropriate action being taken.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Social Media Advice for Swimmers &amp; Parents</h2>

<p>The Club&#39;s Publicity Policy has been aligned with that of the ASA Wavepower in association with the NSPCC and other governing bodies.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">We would therefore like to remind all Parents and Swimmers:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Never share pictures of yourself or your friends that might reach other people that you do not&nbsp;wish to see them.</li>
	<li>Never post or send any photographs, videos or make comments that may be:&nbsp;hurtful, untrue and upsetting and you may regret sharing later on used by other people in a way you did not intend or want.</li>
	<li>Do not put pictures/video footage of other Club members on any site within the Club setting, as you may breach the ASA Photography Guidance. This extends to children (your child or otherwise) in a swimming costume, in the water, poolside or in the changing area.</li>
	<li>Videoing or taking photos during a training session is strictly prohibited. The only exception to this rule is when a coach uses video footage of your child in a controlled environment for means of instructing stroke technique.</li>
	<li>Ensure that the privacy settings on your swimmer&rsquo;s social media accounts are set to the appropriate level.&nbsp; Please be aware that even the highest privacy settings on Facebook will still allow a stranger to send a private message you or your swimmer on your/their personal Facebook page.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Swimmers, if you do wish to upload a picture onto our closed Facebook Group page, you must first have the advice and consent of your parent, along with the other young person and consent from their parent before even considering uploading a photo. All posts, comments and photographs posted to the Club&rsquo;s closed Facebook page are subject to admin approval before being published. This will not prevent you having pictures of your swimming friends on your personal social media site taken outside of the sporting arena but it is good advice to always ensure that they, and their parents, are happy with any picture you have of them on your site.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Always be aware that social networking sites are a method of communication like letter writing and the spoken word. They are bound by the same laws and rules. Such technology is instant and this allows you as the user to react in the &lsquo;heat of the moment&rsquo;, where in the past you would have been required to write a letter, which would have taken time and allowed for you to think again before sending. So never place a comment on the internet that you would not put in writing or say to the individual concerned face to face as to do so may not only breach ASA Policy but also the law.</span></p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 1.6em;">Guidance to parents of ASA members under the age of 18</strong></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">There have been occasions where parents of ASA members have used social networking sites to criticise or verbally abuse swimming Clubs, its officers, officials, coaches, teachers, and swimmers in an inappropriate and unacceptable manner. This has in some cases led the person who is subject of the verbal abuse to take action through statutory agencies or statutory legislation to address the comments made.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The ASA have produced a parent&rsquo;s code of conduct, which all Bluefins Parents have signed and are bound by. Parents are expected to: &ldquo;Behave responsibly as a spectator at training and treat swimmers, coaches, committee members and parents of yours and other Clubs with due respect meeting the ASA commitment to equality&rdquo;.</span></p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 1.6em;">Consequences of Actions</strong></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Parents should be aware that posting messages, photos, comments on any social networking site that breaches the above requirement in an ASA Club are in violation of Parents Code of Conduct.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Any individual found to be in violation of this Policy, may face disciplinary action in accordance with the Club&rsquo;s Disciplinary, Grievance and Complaints Procedures.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">In addition Basingstoke Bluefins will ensure at all times that the necessary measures are taken to Safeguard children and young vulnerable adults.</span></p>
