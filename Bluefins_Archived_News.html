              <span class="blogTitle">Portsmouth Level 1 Easter Meet 2016</span>
              


<p>Whilst most of the nation was tucking into their Easter eggs, a number of Bluefins swimmers were competing at the Portsmouth Level 1 Open Meet over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend.</p>

<p>This meet is longer in duration than most, taking in a full three days, with an additional session for the distance events being held on the Thursday evening. The meet has the added benefit of incorporating a number of finals, and it was great to see Bluefins swimmers taking part in these.</p>

<p>With over fifty Long Course (50 metre Olympic size pool) personal best times being recorded by Bluefins swimmers, there was lots of exciting racing to keep the team buzzing.</p>

<p>Charlyne LeBosse did both herself and the team proud with some excellent performances in the Butterfly events on the Friday, recording a two second lifetime best in the 100 metre event which was enough to secure her 4<sup>th</sup> place in the 14 years &amp; under final, and then another personal best time in the 50 metre event saw her place 3<sup>rd</sup> in the event and in earn a Bronze medal. Charlyne&rsquo;s strong work off the turns and underwater work really made a superb difference to her swims, and it&rsquo;s safe to say she&rsquo;s well on her way to making this part of her racing a real signature skill!</p>

<p>Bluefins swimmers also featured prominently in the Breaststroke event held on Friday, with Amelia Rugman &amp; Amelia Trist both racing well in the 14 &amp; under final of the 100 metre event. It was also great to see Mairead Barker back racing after a short break from competitions. Mairead is a Breaststroke specialist and one of the teams most experienced swimmers, having competed previously in National Championship Finals. Mairead showed good form and also made the final for the 15 &amp; over age group.</p>

<p>Millie Rugman qualified for another final, this time in the 50 metre Breaststroke event on the Saturday, and in a very close race narrowly missed attaining a coveted Gold medal in a cracking time of 36.73 seconds. Saturday also saw Molly Goffin, an experienced National Championship qualifier, swim in her first final of the weekend, this time in the 200 Individual Medley event. Molly was just shy of her lifetime best in the final, recording a time of 2.34.71 and finishing seventh overall.</p>

<p>Julia Lebosse was the third Bluefins swimmer to qualify for a final on Saturday, this time in the Sprint 100 Freestyle event. Julia showed a great turn of pace straight off the blocks, and kept her stroke rate up high enough to secure a lifetime best of 63.68 seconds.</p>

<p>As the final events consisted of two age groups, the 14 years &amp; under, and the 15 years &amp; over, it was always going to be tough for the younger swimmers to record times fast enough to get them into finals at this meet. However, this didn&rsquo;t deter the two youngest members of the team, Conor Cherrington and Alex Heath, from aiming high and vying for medals. Connor had some superb races and on the Sunday came away with no fewer than 4 Gold medals in the 10 &amp; under age group. In the 50 metres Freestyle event, Conor was actually over three seconds faster than the second placed competitor! Alex also showed a great turn of speed in both the 50 Freestyle and Backstroke events, securing 4<sup>th</sup> place in the Freestyle, and a well deserved silver medal in the Backstroke.</p>

<p>Following on from Julia&rsquo;s excellent performance in the 100 metres Freestyle the previous day, she also qualified for the shorter 50 metre Freestyle final on the Sunday. Julia had a good swim on this, the last day, and narrowly missed recording a new lifetime best in the event by 0.05 seconds!</p>

<p>The 200 metres Breaststroke finals were also held on the last day, and Bluefins had five swimmers taking part in these. After a long weekend, this Breaststroke event was always going to be demanding for any swimmer, and it was probably going to be more about racing the other swimmers in the final and not so much about hitting lifetime best times. Mairead Barker and Molly Goffin were in the 15 years and over age group and attained 2<sup>nd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> placings respectively, and in the younger age group, Millie Trist got 4<sup>th</sup> place and Julia LeBosse not far behind in 6<sup>th</sup>. Mitchell Coombes was the other Bluefins representative in a final for this event, and it was great to see him race with some of the best technique he&rsquo;s ever performed! &nbsp;&nbsp;A really well judged race saw him reduce his season best time to 2.30, narrowly missing his lifetime best of 2.29.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">The third and last weekend weekend of the 2016 Hampshire County Championships saw some great performances from Bluefins swimmers.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">In the Junior events, Graeme Richardson did a superb job in the 200 meters Breastroke event, reducing his lifetime best by 4 seconds and securing a silver medal placing. 12 yr old Millie Trist also had a fantastic swim in this event, earning herself a bronze medal in a time three seconds faster than her previous best. Charlyne LeBosse showed great form in the 200m Fly event and was rewarded with a Bronze medal placing. </span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 20.8px;">Sarah-Jayne Cowlam also did superbly, in the 15 year old age group to finish 5</span><sup style="line-height: 20.8px;">th</sup><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;and 6</span><sup style="line-height: 20.8px;">th</sup><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;in the 100 and 50m backstroke respectively, and, in the process achieved her first ever Regional Qualifying times.</span><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;There were also strong swims from Grace Merrin, Louise Evans and Amy Pennicott.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">Breaststroke specialist, Mitchell Coombes, competed in the 16 &amp; over age group and finalled in all three distances in the stroke, with his highest ranked position&nbsp;being 3<sup>rd</sup> in the 200 metre event. Just missing out on a medal in the 100 metre event he finished 4<sup>th</sup>. Molly Goffin, in the same age group, was the club&rsquo;s busiest swimmer over the weekend, setting numerous personal best times, she attained 6<sup>th</sup> place overall in both the 100 metres Breastroke and 200 Individual Medley events, with her highest ranked position being 5<sup>th</sup> in the 200 metres Breaststroke final. While William Sadler swam a 27.75 for the 50m freestyle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">In the youngest age band, 14 &amp; under, Julia LeBosse managed to secure no fewer than four top three placings, with her best result being first in the tough 400 Individual Medley event. This swim was also good enough to place her third overall in the Junior age band, which meant a Bronze medal for her excellent efforts. Not to be outdone by her sister, Charlyne LeBosse won both the 100 and 200 metres butterfly, she came 2<sup>nd</sup> in the 50 Fly and third in the 400 Individual Medley. Millie Trist powered on to first place in the 100 Breastroke, which is a great achievement, particularly when considering she was one of the youngest swimmers at the competition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">Whilst the above summary details events in which top three placings were attained, there were also many other superb swims from Bluefins swimmers. Just qualifying for these championships is an achievement in itself, and congratulations should go to all who took part in the championships over the past few weeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">The swimmers sights now are firmly being set on attaining the coveted Regional Qualifying standards and also on the opening of the time window for National Championship qualification.&nbsp; If the County championships were anything to go by, we should be in for some exciting racing over the next few months, watch this space!.........</span></p>&nbsp;&nbsp

<p>The middle weekend of 2016 Hampshire County Championships was held at Waterlooville on 30 and 31 January. This weekend saw a full programme of races up to 200m for swimmers aged 14 and under.</p>

<p>Basingstoke Bluefins had another very successful meet, claiming 8 gold medals, 7 silvers, 3 bronze and having 14 further finalists, along with numerous personal best times.</p>

<p>Amelia Trist led the way for Bluefins with a fantastic haul of 3 golds and 2 silvers. Swimming in the 13 year old category, Trist won both the 200m breaststroke and butterfly by over 4 seconds, as well as winning the 100m breaststroke and coming second in the 50m breaststroke and 100m Butterfly.</p>

<p>In the youngest aged group, 10 and 11 year olds, Alexander Heath and Conor Cherrington showed that the future is bright for the club. Cherrington won the 200m breaststroke by a 5 second margin and gained silver in the 50 and 100m breaststroke and 50m butterfly. Heath won gold in the 100m backstroke and picked up bronze for both the 50m and 200m backstroke as well as reaching the final of the 50m freestyle.</p>

<p>In the 14 year old category John Holt won gold in the 100 and 200m Butterfly and came second in the 50m Butterfly. Julia Lebosse won the 50m freestyle, finished 2<sup>nd</sup> in the 200m breaststroke and reached the finals of the 50 and 100m breaststroke as well as the 100m backstroke. Aemilia Rugman won a silver medal in the 100m breaststroke and reached the final of the 50m breaststroke.</p>

<p>For the 13 year olds, Isla Haynes finished third in the 200m butterfly as well as reaching the finals in the 50 and 100m butterfly.</p>

<p>The other Bluefins finalists were Emily Rogerson in the 12 year olds 50m breaststroke, Chloe Garlinge in the 10/11 years old breaststroke and in the 14 years old group Kieran Parker reached the finals of the 50 and 100m backstroke, Charlyne Lebosse missed bronze in the 100m butterfly by 0.2 seconds as well as making the final in the 50m butterfly and Laura Helyar reached the final of the 50m breaststroke.</p>

<p>The third and final weekend of the Championships takes place on 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> February in the 50m pool at Portsmouth for 15 year olds and over.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

              <span class="blogTitle">Hampshire Counties 2016 - Weekend 1</span>
              


<p>Last weekend was the first of three weekends of the Hampshire County Championships, and Bluefins swimmers got of to a great start! The first round of the championships was based in the Olympic size 50 metre pool at Portsmouth, and staged the distance events and also some relays.</p>

<p>This meet was the first time this season that most of the swimmers competed in a long course (50 metre) pool, and provided an excellent opportunity for swimmers to prepare for future long course events later in the season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first event was the Girls 400 Individual Medley, one of the toughest events in the competition programme, and one which requires swimmers to show all round swimming ability due to the fact that it encompasses all strokes.</p>

<p>Bluefins girls showed some great pacing and skills, with six out of the seven girls ranking in the top ten in their age group. Millie Trist was our highest ranked swimmer in the event, narrowly missing becoming County Champion by less than 1.5 seconds! &nbsp;</p>

<p>The next event was the boys 400 Freestyle, and the two Bluefins swimmers, James Marston and John Holt did a great job, maintaining their skills and stroke length throughout the race.</p>

<p>The girls 10-12 yrs relays followed the 400 metre events on Saturday, and the Bluefins teams, including Jessica Bettesworth, Emily Rogerson, Lexi Bird, and Chloe Garlinge, performed superbly.&nbsp; They all worked together and handled the pressure well, especially considering this was the first time the girls had competed in a County Championship competition, and also a long course pool!</p>

<p>Last event on the Saturday was one of my personal favourites, the 800 metres Freestyle. Alice Mardell, Isla Haynes and Mille Trist competed in the 13yrs age group and all three girls attained lifetime bests, in one instance by over a minute! Not only were the times fast, they also worked well on specific areas of their race, particularly speed into and out of turns ( a must for any aspiring distance swimmer) which will stand them in good stead for future races.</p>

<p>Laura Helyar, swimming in the 14 yr age group, did a fantastic job in this event, she showed great determination and toughness, particularly in the last part of the race where she pushed on to a really strong finish, recording her first ever long course 800 time, which was only a few seconds slower than the short course time she recorded just a few months ago, no mean feat considering short course swimming is nearly always considerably faster than long course, manly due to the extra speed swimmers can get from there being more turns in the race.</p>

<p>Last swimmer up for Bluefins in this, the longest of the events for girls, was Molly Goffin. Molly competed in the 16 &amp; over age group and was the club&rsquo;s most experienced female competitior at the competition. And she certainly used her experience to great effect!&nbsp; Beating her lifetime best by nearly 20 seconds. With a very consistently paced race, she actually negative split the swim (the second half was faster than the first!). On reflection, Molly said she could actually have gone out a little faster at the start, which is an exciting prospect, considering she is now only a few seconds away from dipping under the 10 minute mark! Recording a time of 10.04.60 was good enough for Molly to attain 4<sup>th</sup> place.</p>

<p>Day 2 saw the 400 meter events reversed, with the girls competing in the 400 Freestyle, and boys in the 400 Medley. Six out of the nine swims from Bluefins swimmers were top 10 placings, with all bar one being in a personal best long course time.</p>

<p>The relay races on Sunday provided great excitement for the team. The boys 10-12 yr teams, made up of James Marston, Alex Heath, Conor Cherrington, George Dillow and Alex Cleaver, showed excellent technique and speed, and attained 5<sup>th</sup> Place in the Freestyle event, and 4<sup>th</sup> in the Medley. The distance each swimmer races is 50 metres, so it&rsquo;s not unusual to see younger swimmers bashing up the pool with questionable technique and skills over such a short distance. It was therefore fantastic to see our boys swimming not only fast, but also with good form &ndash; something which will undoubtedly be a great asset to them over the coming years as they progress in their swimming careers.</p>

<p>Not wishing to be outshone by their younger team mates, the girls 13-14 yrs teams stepped up with some great performances. The teams, including&nbsp;Julia Lebosse, Millie Rugman, Millie Trist and Charlyne Lebosse did a great job. The Freestyle team narrowly missed a bronze medal place by less than a second, and the Medley team took top honours and became County Champions.</p>

<p>The last race of the weekend was the longest of all, the boys 1500 metres freestyle. Two Bluefins swimmers competed in this tough event, and both swam well. Lewis Fenn recorded his first long course time in the event. He paced himself so consistently that 28 out of the 30 split times for each length were within a second of each other. Graeme Richardson also showed real determination and toughness in his race, recording a lifetime best of 18.41, which earned him 4<sup>th</sup> place in the 15 yr age category.</p>

<p>Next weekend sees the second round of the championships, for swimmers aged 14 and under, being staged at the short course pool at Waterlooville, and if the first round was anything to go by, we should see some exciting racing from the Bluefins age group swimmers!</p>&nbsp;&nbsp

              <span class="blogTitle">Advertising Easter Meet 2016</span>
              


<p>In April this year we are hosting a Level 3 Open Meet at the Aquadrome, Basingstoke. We expect to attract approximately 300 swimmers of all ages, ranging from 9/10 through to 17 plus; primarily from Hampshire, Berkshire, Surrey and surrounding areas.</p>

<p>The majority of the swimmers attending the open meets will be with their parents/guardians who will spend a large part of the day watching the events from the spectator gallery with a competition programme that they can purchase when entering the gallery. These are used to keep track of what event is taking place, who is swimming and to see where their child is seeded in comparison to others that have entered.</p>

<p>If you are a local business or service and you would be interested in advertising what you do in our programme, we would be more than happy to discuss ideas with you. A range of options are available, from sponsoring the entire meet or sponsoring individual events , through to placing a full page, half page or quarter page which will advertise your services in the programme. Costs range from &pound;25 for a race sponsorship to &pound;200 for a full colour, full page advert.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you have products or services that you, your business or your employer would like to donate to our raffles that run at each event please contact us.</p>
